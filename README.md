# Ceaser CSS Easing TextMate bundle

This is a TextMate bundle that adds snippets for the Ceaser CSS Easing Equations.

## Install

I recommend using GetBundles to install it, but if not...

You can download the bundle and install it:

1. Download the zip and unzip it
2. Rename the long crazy name to 'Ceaser CSS Easing.tmbundle'. For example from something like: matthewlein-Ceaser-CSS-Easing-tmbundle-3d0b424 to: Ceaser CSS Easing.tmbundle
3. Double-click the Ceaser CSS Easing.tmbundle file
4. Open TextMate and go to Bundles > Bundle Editor > Reload Bundles
5. Go to Bundles > Bundle Editor > Show Bundle Editor
6. It should be there
