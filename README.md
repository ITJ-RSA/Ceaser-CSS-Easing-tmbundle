# Ceaser CSS Easing Equations TextMate bundle

This is a TextMate bundle that adds snippets for the Ceaser CSS Easing Equations.

## Install

I think this should eventually show up in GetBundles, but for now...

You can download the bundle and install it:

1. download the zip and unzip it
2. Double-click the Ceaser CSS Easing.tmbundle file
5. Open TextMate and go to Bundles > Bundle Editor > Reload Bundles
6. Go to Bundles > Bundle Editor > Show Bundle Editor
7. It should be there

Leave any feedback in the github page.
